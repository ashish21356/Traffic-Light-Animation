# Traffic Light Animation

This project simulates a traffic light system with green, yellow, and red light intervals along with a moving vehicle animation. It also includes a theme-switching feature that toggles between light and dark modes, with a sun and moon visual for added effect.

## Features

### Traffic Light Control
- Users can input intervals (in milliseconds) for green, yellow, and red lights.
- The traffic lights will change color according to the intervals.

### Vehicle Animation
- A vehicle moves from right to left.
- The vehicle pauses when it reaches the red light and resumes when the light turns green or yellow.

### Dark Mode
- The theme can be switched between light mode (sun) and dark mode (moon), with corresponding changes in background and lighting effects.

### Star and Headlight Effects
- Stars and headlight animations are included for visual enhancement during the night theme.

## How to Use

### Traffic Light Controls
1. Enter the time intervals (in milliseconds) for the green, yellow, and red lights.
2. Click the Start button to begin the traffic light sequence.
3. Click the Stop button to stop the light sequence.

### Vehicle Animation
1. Click the Click to Move button to start moving the vehicle from right to left.
2. The vehicle will automatically pause when it reaches the red light and resume when the light turns green or yellow.

### Theme Toggle
1. Click the Dark button to switch to dark mode (night theme).
   - The button text will change to Light.
   - The background will become dark with stars, headlights, and a glowing moon.
2. Click the Light button to switch back to light mode (day theme).

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The structure of the page, including input fields for intervals, buttons for control, and containers for the traffic lights and vehicle animation.
- **CSS**: Styling for the page layout, vehicle, traffic lights, headlight, and theme effects (sun, moon, stars).
- **JavaScript**: Logic for controlling traffic light intervals, moving the vehicle across the screen, pausing the vehicle when it reaches the red light, and toggling between light and dark themes.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the project.
- Inline CSS and JavaScript are included within the `index.html` file for styling and interactivity.

## Installation

No additional installation is needed. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the animation and interact with the traffic light system.

## Instructions for Customization

1. Adjust the default position, size, and appearance of the vehicle, lights, and stars by modifying the corresponding CSS properties.
2. Extend the JavaScript code to add more traffic lights or complex behaviors like random intervals or more vehicle interactions.
